# User Data Streams for Coins (2024-05-17)

## General WSS information

* The base endpoint is: **https://api.coins.xyz**
* A User Data Stream `listenKey` is valid for 60 minutes after creation.
* Doing a `PUT` on a `listenKey` will extend its validity for 60 minutes.
* Doing a `DELETE` on a `listenKey` will close the stream and invalidate the listenKey.
* Doing a `POST` on an account with an active `listenKey` will return the currently active `listenKey` and extend its validity for 60 minutes.
* The base websocket endpoint is: **wss://wsapi.coins.xyz**
* User Data Streams are accessed at **/openapi/ws/\<listenKey\>**
* A single connection to api endpoint is only valid for 24 hours; expect to be disconnected at the 24 hour mark
